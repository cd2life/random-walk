# random-walk
Here we created art using circles in random walk.

<h2>Installation</h2>
To see the Random Walk in action, save all three files in a single folder and open randomWalk.html in your browser. You should make it so it can resource ball.js and mystyle.css. There are two ways to create balls and get them random walking. You can click and drag down or you can type into the browser console "factory(number of balls)" and then "update()".

<h2>Usage</h2>
One way to use these files is to create a screenshot and post as artwork.

<h2>Support</h2>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
Later I am hoping to update the colors and borders for a better color scheme.
